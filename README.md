Find out how to modify terrain height and texture from C# script in this tutorial video. You may want to modify the terrain height as an in game feature from a hit or explosion. And, changing the texture through script may be useful if you want to leave tracks on the terrain or some other effect. I plan to use the changing texture knowledge to leave skid marks on a race track.
